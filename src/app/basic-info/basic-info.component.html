        <p>
            <strong>Since 2017, UK businesses, charities and public sector organisations have been able to choose who supplies their water, meaning they can now avoid being locked into costly contracts.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>If your business still hasnâ€™t switched, you could make significant savings by comparing water suppliers to find a better deal.</p>
